            The logo for CSS
            Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is a way to change the look of HTML and XHTML web pages. CSS was designed by the W3C, and is supported well by most modern web browsers. The current version of CSS is CSS3. CSS4 is available, but is split into parts.
            One advantage to using CSS is a web page can still be displayed, even if the CSS is not working or removed.
            CSS code is saved in files with the .css file extension
            To import a CSS file you would use <link rel="stylesheet" href="CSS_FILE_NAME_HERE.css"> or for a folder you would use <link rel="stylesheet" href="FOLDER_NAME_HERE/CSS_FILE_NAME_HERE.css"> in HTML.
            In CSS you would use @import url("CSS_FILE_NAME_HERE.css"); or for a folder you would use @import url(FOLDER_NAME_HERE/CSS_FILE_NAME_HERE.css"); to import CSS into your CSS.

            HTML uses "elements" to let the browser know how a webpage is made of. Tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag defines the start of a block of content and a closing tag defines the end of that block of content. There are many kinds of tags, and each one has a different purpose. See Basic HTML Tags below for tag examples
                Some tags only work in certain browsers. For example, the tag, which was used to make something appear when the person presses the right button of the mouse, only worked on the Mozilla Firefox browser until version 85.[2] Other browsers simply ignore this tag and display the writing normally. Many web page creators avoid using these "non-standard" tags because they want their pages to look the same with all browsers.

            HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language used to create web pages. It was created in 1990 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist who is credited with inventing the World Wide Web.[1] Webpages can include writing, links, pictures,
             and even sound and video. HTML tells web browsers what webpages should look like. HTML also adds meta information to webpages. Meta information is information about a webpage e.g., the name of the person who created the page. Web browsers usually do not show meta information.
HTML is often used with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript. CSS is used to change the way HTML looks. JavaScript tells websites how to behave. It can also change HTML and CSS.
